# Recipe-Share-Website

> > Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the Forkify API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and save to a favorites list via local storage. The user can easily increase or decrease servings as per his need and can view detailed directions.

> > This project is build during this [amazing javascirpt course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). under the guidance of [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/)

## ðŸš© Get Started

1. make sure you have npm installed
2. clone the repo `git clone <your repo>`
3. inside the repo directory run `npm install`
4. run `npm run build`

#### Note

- In case of having problems using the current api, try running `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`
  before running `npm run build`

- I am migrating this project to NextJs and adding some features to this application such as:
    - Login/Sign Up flow
    - Account and Admin Priviledges
    - Delete API
    - Blog Post

- If you have more suggestions then please reach out to me! I would love to work and maintain further as we can potentially help students find easy recipies!
